# Coding workflow

  1. Look for new updates on github and merge those changes into your local repo
  
    > **git fetch**
    > **git merge**
    
  2. Make some local changes of your own.  Compile and test.
  3. Stage some changes and commit them (locally)
  
    > **git add -p**
    > **git commit -m "A helpful message about the changes you made"**
    
  4. Repeat from step #2
  5. When you are ready, push the changes up to github
  
    > **git push**
    
  6. Repeat from step #1
