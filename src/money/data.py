        We are interested in how our value is moving around, going up, going
        down. But, we can only track what quantities we have.

        I have a house.
        I have $3000 in the bank.
        I have 4 shares of Apple Stock
        I have 2.1 bitcoin
        I have 1 acre of land
        I have 12 eggs

        
        The _value_ of the things that you have is variable.
        If you are stranded in the middle of a desert only one of those things
        has any value.

        Inflation means your $3000 is becoming less valuable over time, but
        your Apple Stock might become more valuable over time.  The eggs have
        a pretty constant value (for a short period of time).

        The problem with value is that it does not obey conservation laws.  For
        example, gravity obeys conservation laws.  If you go for bike ride you
        might ride up hill or downhill, but when you return home you are
        guaranteed that you rode uphill exactly as much as you got to go
        downhill.

        Value doesn't obey that law (it should), this is one of the reasons I
        dont like economics.  You can trade things around in a circle and you
        will usually come out with less value than when you started.  If you
        are very clever you might get back _more_ value than when you started.
        That is very irritating.


        Value is created:
            * Working at a job
            * Building a table

        Value is destroyed:
            * Blowing up your car
            * Eating food

        Value takes on many forms:
            * Gold
            * Real Estate
            * Yen
            * Stock
            * Etc.

        So we have to keep track of the things we have, and then work out how
        much value that is.  How much value is it? 
        Value can only be measured by trade.  You have to compare what you have with something
        else to assess its value.  Some demands are fairly constant (hunger) so
        you can use those as stable reference points to calculate the values of
        other commodities.  So how much bread can you get for your car?  That
        is how valuable your car is.  Is there a more constant reference than
        our appitite to measure value against?

        Our Possesions may have value but there may be barriers to trade.  It
        is easy to trade money in the bank to cash in your hand.  It is hard to
        trade your house into cash in your hand.  This barrier is dependant
        on the two tradeables.
